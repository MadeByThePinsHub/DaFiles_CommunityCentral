## Ang Mga Pangunahing Kaalaman

### What is this Gitbook space?

An resource hub where we place everything about anything from fandoms to zebras and its markdown code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/malaspinsphdev/DaFiles_CommunityCentral) to make it open-source.

### Can I localize it for my own language?

Surely, yes! Create your own, then integrate with an GitHub repo you made, just like this one, so we can review and add it to our repo as an branch. Please [inform us at Telegram first](https://t.me/joinchat/Kg1fIBTLOiGA4FyaI6zT5g) so we can attribute your localized versions of this space.

### What are "scanlations" in manga?

Simply say, people scan "raw" copies of manga from Japan, translate them and distribute them on their own without permission. It's not legal and highly discouraged as it's not commonly accurate translations or official.

When you visit unofficial sources, please pay attention to any of the errors do the unofficial distributors made in their scanlations.
