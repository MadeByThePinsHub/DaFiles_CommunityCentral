### What are "scanlations" in manga?

Simply say, people scan "raw" copies of manga from Japan, translate them and distribute them on their own without permission. It's not legal and highly discouraged as it's not commonly accurate translations or official.

When you visit unofficial sources, please pay attention to any of the errors do the unofficial distributors made in their scanlations.
